# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
I analyzed data from a school district, including students' math and reading performances, school type, budget, and student body count. The data was used to provide metrics such as the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, average math and reading scores in each grade level at each school, the scores by school spending per student, scores by school size, and scores by school type. I analyzed the data a second time due to potential academic dishonesty within the Thomas High School ninth graders' scores to see how this affected the overall analysis.  

## Results
- The potential academic dishonesty by the Thomas High School ninth graders have very litte effect on the overall district summary. The % of students passing math, reading, and overall decrease by very little. 
- The school summary has some minor changes as well due to the academic dishonesty. The overall passing % at Thomas High School goes down from 90.95% to 90.63%, with both math and reading percentages decreasing individually as well.

- Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores does not affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools. Thomas High School remains in the top performing schools. 
- Replacing the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School does the following to each category: 
  - Math and reading scores by grade: Thomas High School's 9th grader grades are replaced with nan, but has no other differences.
  - Scores by school spending: no changes 
  - Scores by school size: no changes
  - Scores by school type: no changes

## Conclusion
Some changes in the updated school district analysis after eading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced are: 

  1. % of students passing math at Thomas High School and the overall district experienced a slight decrease
  2. % of students passing reading at Thomas High School and the overall district experienced a slight decrease
  3. % of students passing overall at Thomas High School and the overall district experienced a slight decrease
  4. The total student count for both Thomas High School and the overall district have decreased due to the nullified values

Overall, we've found that not much has changed in the overall performance within the district and at Thomas High School when the ninth graders' scores were replaced with NaNs.
