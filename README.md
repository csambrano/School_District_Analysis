# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
I analyzed data from a school district, including students' math and reading performances, school type, budget, and student body count. The data was used to provide metrics such as the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, average math and reading scores in each grade level at each school, the scores by school spending per student, scores by school size, and scores by school type. I analyzed the data a second time due to potential academix dishonesty within the Thomas High School ninth graders' scores to see how this affected the overall analysis.
